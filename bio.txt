Hello, my name is Amanda! I am a former Medical assistant for a Cardiology group in Newport Beach.
I enjoy horseback riding and yoga.
I recently started playing Stardew Valley on Steam.
I love naps and snacks. 
My career goals are to combine my medical background with web development, possibly working with electronic medical records.
